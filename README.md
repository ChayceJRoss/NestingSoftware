# NestingSoftware
A portfolio project designed to teach ourselves about algorithms, using GitHub and python programming. <br>
The goal of the project is to create software that optimises the cuts for given raw material and pattern inputs. 
Initially, we would like to achieve this with 1-dimensional parts and once this is complete to move on to 2-
dimensional cuts with regular rectangular parts, and finally if possible with 2-dimensional cuts with irregular parts.
